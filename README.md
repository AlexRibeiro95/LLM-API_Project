# Language Model API Mini Project

## Project Statement

In this mini-project, you will explore Language Models using an API of your choice, such as ChatGPT or any other AI API. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in utilizing Language Models and understanding their capabilities. You will select a use case or create a simple business case and implement it by leveraging the chosen API.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose a Language Model API

You can use the GPT API or select an API provider, such as Hugging Face API, based on availability or personal preference.

### Step 2: API Setup and Credentials

1. Sign up for the chosen API provider and obtain the necessary API keys or access tokens.
2. Follow the providerâ€™s documentation to understand the authentication process and ensure you have the required permissions to make API requests.

### Step 3: Implementing the Use Case

1. **Select a Use Case**: Choose a specific use case or business scenario where you can leverage the Language Model API. This could involve tasks such as generating text, answering questions, providing recommendations, or any other language-related task.

2. **Write Code to Interact with the API**: Experiment with different parameters, such as prompt input, temperature, and any other relevant parameters that impact the output generated by the Language Model.

3. **Analyze Responses**: Make API requests and analyze the responses to observe how the chosen parameters influence the results. Note any interesting findings or challenges encountered during the implementation.

4. **Document Your Findings**: Prepare a Jupyter Notebook and/or Python files following best coding practices to showcase your work.

## API Integration

### API Setup

- **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed to interact with the API.

- **Set Up API Credentials**: Set up your API credentials to authenticate requests.

### Implementing the Use Case

1. **Define the Use Case**: Clearly define the use case or business scenario you are addressing with the Language Model API.

2. **Make API Requests**: Use the API to send requests based on your use case, experimenting with different parameters to optimize the results.

3. **Handle and Analyze Responses**: Process the responses from the API, analyzing how changes in parameters like temperature and max tokens affect the output.

### Experimentation with Parameters

1. **Experiment with Parameters**: Test different values for parameters like temperature and max tokens to see how they influence the generated text or responses.

2. **Analyze Results**: Compare the outputs generated with different parameter settings to determine the best configuration for your use case.
